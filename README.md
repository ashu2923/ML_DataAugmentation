# ML_DataAugmentation

Scripts and commands for augmenting machine learning data sets for the remote sensing domain.

Other utility script exist, such as creating 5-fold or 10-fold cross validation data sets.

Scripts originally developed for the UC Merced data.

## Augmenting UC Merced

[Get UC Merced Land Use Dataset](http://vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html)

Don't forget to acknowledge data set creators:

Yi Yang and Shawn Newsam, "Bag-Of-Visual-Words and Spatial Extensions for Land-Use Classification," ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (ACM GIS), 2010. 

## Augmenting RSDataset
This data set can be obtained from the authors of the following paper.

Acknowledge the data set creators:

Dai, D., Yang, W.: Satellite image classiÔ¨Åcation via two-layer sparse coding with biased image representation. 
IEEE Geosci. Remote Sens. Lett. 8(1), 173176 (2011)

## Use the scripts:

These scripts require caffe to use. [The guide to installing caffe can be found here](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html)

See the readme files in the appropriate directories for directions on how to use those scripts.
