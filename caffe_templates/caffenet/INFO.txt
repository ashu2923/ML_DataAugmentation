Source is the original caffe files straight from github, minus the model itself since it's 240MB

get_caffe_model does literally that, just moved the link from the source readme into wget

Locked/Unlocked refers to the convolutional net
 Unlocked for finetuning of the feature extractors
 Locked for only reinterpretation via IP and classifier layers

Changed from source network:
 Tossed readme
 Added snaps folder 
 Solver: 
  Learning rate moved back a place to 0.001
  Iteration count moved to 100000
  Step size dropped to 60000
  Snapshot bumped up to 50000
  Lowered batch sizes because it breaks cuda
  ** Network file is a relative path in the same directory **
  ** Snapshot prefix is a relative path to the snaps directory **
  ** Read: Execute caffe from within the directory **

 Train_val:
  New classifier added, literally appended "_new" to it, changed output total
  Meanfile set to MEANFILE_PATH for find/replace
  Disabled mirroring, kept crop size at 227
  Training data path set to TRAINING_DATA_PATH for find/replace
  Testing data path set to TESTING_DATA_PATH for find/replace

 Deploy:
  Updated with new classifier name and output number
  Set first dim to 1 because we only want/have 1 since we don't want random crops

In addition to the above changes, the Locked network also sets convolution layer learning multipliers to zero
