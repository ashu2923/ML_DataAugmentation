Caffe has an ImageData layer which uses the row db config files I use to generate the DBs.
This is so much simpler, and means we don't have to wait all day to generate new DBs.

Caffe suggests, as makes sense, that there is a performance hit for this "..., or, when efficiency is not critical, from files on disk ..."
Wish I knew this before...

But, it'll be useful for passing arbitrary files through for extraction, so I'm going to add an "extract.prototxt" with the ususal find/replace flags for use with this. Unlike the train stuff, don't overwrite this prototxt. place the filled out version somewhere else.

EXTRACT_CONFIG_PATH will be the path to the DB config file, which is an <fname> <label> pair. label isn't really important for extraction, but a value needs to be there.

MEANFILE_PATH should/will be filled out ahead of time

NOTE: These DB configs will be expected to have an abs/rel path to the data from the current working directory (no root/label file combo), so it will probably be best to make these configs use abs paths and then just toss it when extraction is done.
